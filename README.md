<h1>STAE Stablecoin Platform</h1>	

This repository contains the core smart contracts for the STAE Stablecoin Platform. The system uses cryptoassets as collateral to peg the stablecoin to a FIAT. THe system supports BTC, ETH, and any ERC20 tokens as collateral to help peg the stablecoin. Each collateral will have its own risk parameters to incentivize Backers (market makers) to maintain the peg.

<h2>Collateral<h2>
  
  The collateral is the foundation of all stablecoins created by STAE. Each stablecoin is backed/collateralized by a cryptoasset with a FIAT value such as ETH, BTC, any ERC20 token, or any ERC827 token. Other cryptoassets on other blockchains may be added in the future and will be handled similar to BTC.
